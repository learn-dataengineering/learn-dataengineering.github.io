### What is Python?

**Python** is a general purpose object-oriented programming language with high-level programming capabilities. Developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

+ **Open Source** general-purpose programming language.
+ **High-level programming language** (i.e. independent of the computer’s hardware).
+ **Interpreted** (i.e. not need to compile your program before executing it, Python is processed at run-time by the interpreter)
+ **Multiple Programming Paradigms** ( i.e. Python supports object oriented programming, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles)
+ **Code Readability** – Python is easy to read, write & maintain.
+ **Interactive** –   IDLE is Python’s built-in Integrated Development Environment. It has a Python shell window, which gives you access to the Python interactive mode.

>Python is fully-functional programming language that can do almost anything.
